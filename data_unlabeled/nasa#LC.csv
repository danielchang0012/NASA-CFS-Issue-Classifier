"apps should check / verify msg <allcaps> before </allcaps> calling handler <section> this remains an area with coding pattern discrepancies between <allcaps> cfe </allcaps> core and <allcaps> cfs </allcaps> apps , and also different between <allcaps> cfs </allcaps> apps to some degree as well . the <allcaps> cfe </allcaps> core and sample app ( which is supposed to be the example of "" best practice "" ) do validation on the message before calling the handler . for example : <code> this is different from lc , which does a similar check , but done inside each handler , for example : <url> <section> <allcaps> cfs </allcaps> apps should follow the best practices / patterns set forth in the framework code . ( there are reasons for the pattern being recommended practice ) <section> the pattern recommended in the framework ( checking before calling , as done in sample_app ) has several advantages : <number> . each command handler function has a unique type - safe prototype , that cannot be interchanged with another handler without triggering a type mismatch compiler error . <number> . all typecasting / conversions are confined to one place , and it is nearby to the place that the verification is done - which eases maintainability because check and conversion are all in close proximity and any mismatches will be more visible . <number> . it spreads out the cyclomatic complexity . in the non - recommended pattern , there is a case where the length check fails , and the entire handler is essentially skipped . this adds to the cyclomatic complexity of every handler . in the recommended pattern , those checks are done prior to the invocation of the handler , so the handler can focus solely on its intended purpose - doing the command itself . <section> joseph hickey , vantage systems , inc ."
