"revisit "" format - check "" workflow - is it needed ? <section> the cfs <allcaps> ccb </allcaps> should revisit the cost / benefit of enforcing the "" format - check "" workflow on every push / pull . the original idea was that it would keep the white space formatting consistent , but in practice there are a lot of nuisances that result from this : - perpetually changing the alignment of variable names ( in declarations ) and the equal sign ( in groups of assignments ) causes extra merge conflicts . this is because a single added variable or assignment might change a group of lines rather than just the single line that added it . if another change is made in parallel nearby that causes lines to be grouped that were not grouped before , this is now a merge conflict , whereas without the formatting change it would be a trivial auto merge . - changes to the tool ( outside our control ) cause changes to the expected formatting of lines . for example clang - format - <number> , which is what the workflow was originally based on , formats slightly differently than clang - format - <number> and clang - format - <number> do , and there is no way ( via config file ) to get an identical output from the newer versions . clang - format - <number> is no longer installable in the most recent "" <allcaps> lts </allcaps> "" distros - this means that as developer transition to newer dev environments , we will not be able to reproduce the expected formatting easily . - the ultimate objective is to make source code most readable for humans , but the tool does not know context , and sometimes "" strict adherence "" to a set of rules yields a _less_ readable result than what a human would write . a prime example is when a table initializer is grouped into logical rows and columns based on its context . for examples of this , see the "" cfe_tbl_cmdhandlertbl "" from an old version of <allcaps> cfe </allcaps> , before clang - format enforcement : <url> compared to the same table in the current version after clang - format messes with the column alignments , start and end braces , etc : <url> other examples include the es object table and any event registration table , where what was originally a logically aligned table became all disorganized . - lastly , we have a few instances of what was a perfectly "" compliant "" source ( see <url> suddenly starts being non - compliant ( see <url> note that the file that failed here ( fm_child_tests . c ) did _not_ change between these two runs . something else changed , but its the same version of clang - format and the same . clang - format file from what i can tell . <section> tools should be a help , not a hinderance . keeping up with clang - format nuisance errors might not be the best use of developer time ? <section> provided inline <section> ubuntu , debian <section> joseph hickey , vantage systems , inc ."

"update format check workflow to newer clang - format version <section> the format check workflow is currently running on ubuntu <number> , which in turn includes clang - format version <number> by default . versions of clang - format up through <number> have a bug / limitation where the <code> setting is not implemented . the cfs format config has this set as "" right "" : <url> however , in version <number> this was fixed , and it now honors this setting . as such , if a user has a newer version , they will get format discrepancies when trying to submit a pr . this is the case when using ubuntu <number> as it includes version <number> by default . for an example , see any struct that contains a pointer , such as : <code> now needs to be : <code> due to the <code> now taking effect . unfortunately , setting <code> does not replicate the version <number> format either , it produces this instead : <code> sadly it seems there is no backward - compatible option to replicate the version <number> format with version <number> ( or at least none that i could find ) . furthermore , it is not possible to install version <number> in ubuntu <number> either . <section> eventually , we will have to upgrade to a newer version of clang - format , and deal with these discrepancies . as a transition , version <number> is easily installable on ubuntu <number> via the packages offered from <code> ( official upstream for clang ) . recommendation would be to change the format - check workflow to run version <number> instead of version <number> , and update the code accordingly for all of the whitespace differences it produces similar to the above example . this can be done by simply bumping the <code> to be ubuntu <number> instead of <number> , and changing nothing else ( note that this needs to happen eventually anyway , since <code> is now <number> on github , and <number> will be deprecated at some point , although this may be a while yet ) . <section> in the interim , it is possible to install clang - format version <number> on both ubuntu <number> and <number> , which seems to produce the same format as v10 did ( at least with cfs config file ) . but this is not the default version in either , and only defers the issue , because v12 depends on a version of python that is no longer available in <number> or newer and thus becomes non - installable in anything newer . so this does not resolve the incompatibility , it only adds setup complexity while delaying the eventuality of having to deal with the whitespace changes . <section> joseph hickey , vantage systems , inc ."

to - end testing solution . as a consequence , this tool is not yet integrated into the existing travis configuration , and the test runner performs a simple assertion . this contribution is also limited by the technical characteristics of docker . in particular : * broadly speaking , docker does not natively and / or straightforwardly support "" non - standard "" operating systems ( e . g . <allcaps> rtos </allcaps> ) . that explains why , for instance ( and unfortunately ) , vxworks is presently not supported by this solution . alternative or complementary approaches will be needed to extend automated end - to - end to other platforms . * unit tests systematically fail when the cfs images are being built ( see below , * additional context <wink> . this is one of the reasons why they are disabled by default . it should also be noted that an alpine image is included ( <code> ) but is currently not operational , mainly because of the following error : <code> ( see : < <url> i have decided to keep it because it is conceivable that it becomes operational in the future . # testing performed in the context of this proof of context , a simple flow is tested by the <code> test runner ( <code> <sad> * try to enable the telemetry * if the telemetry cannot be enabled , the test fails * otherwise , send a <code> command ( for the <allcaps> sample </allcaps> app ) packet to the cfs * if a <code> event appears in the telemetry message sent by the cfs , the test passes * otherwise , the test fails # expected behavior changes this contribution does not modify the existing code . therefore , no behavior changes are expected . # system ( s ) tested on # # hosts <section> * ubuntu <number> * virtualbox <number> * docker <number> . <number> * docker -

<allcaps> gsw </allcaps> is a python program , running in its own container , that , at this stage , performs a simple assertion and returns a zero ( success ) or non - zero ( failure ) exit code . it is a proof of concept which , obviously , and if the present proposal is accepted , will have to be reworked and replaced by a more robust test runner . <section> <code> and <code> services are interacting on their own internal network managed by docker compose ( <code> , lines <number> -
