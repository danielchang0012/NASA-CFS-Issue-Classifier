"export does not export macro definitions the current export format ( at least for <allcaps> csv </allcaps> and <allcaps> json </allcaps> ) does not contain a definition of the project macros . the dialog contains an option to substitute macro values for macro names , however this does not preserve the definition of the macro . i am using macros to define and ensure that enumeration values stay in sync . for example , if two packets telemeter the same type of enumeration , its desirable to have a single definition for that enumeration to eliminate the possibility of them accidentally being defined differently . this is achievable via macros ( ie , define a macro containing the definition of the enumeration and then use the macro in the enumeration field of both table rows ) , however the value of the enumeration is not exported unless the substitute option has been checked , in which case the single definition of both enumerations is lost when imported . i think it would be useful to export the definition of the macro if the substitute option is not selected ( so that the user has access to the macro values ) and to import macro definitions if found in the file being imported ."
"methods of inspecting script values at runtime it would be very useful to be able to inspect values within <allcaps> ccdd </allcaps> scripts at runtime , which i do not believe is currently possible . this capability could be utilized for script development / debugging and could also be used for archiving the status / state / results of scripts beyond the success / fail that is currently logged . exposing a method in the scripting <allcaps> api </allcaps> to allow writing a message to the <allcaps> ccdd </allcaps> log file may be one way to provide this capability . its currently possible to write short strings to the showerrordialog / showwarningdialog methods , but dismissing those dialogs requires user interaction and does not appear to result in a log entry . thanks"
"longer stack trace for errors in scripts the error handling for the scripting interface only logs the top of the stack trace , which complicates script debugging . the following are an examples of error messages printed to the log upon encountering an error in a script : <code> <code> in both cases the error is reported as having occurred on line <number> , which ( for this script ) is the top - level parent function in the call stack in which the error occurred . in my case , this is a large helper function which implements the entire algorithm and these errors occurred in two different child functions , which can be complicated to track down . it would be very helpful to log longer / deeper stack traces . thanks"

"possible command import bug ? i am currently integrating a c2 system called <allcaps> cosmos </allcaps> with <allcaps> ccdd </allcaps> for use with cubesats . the telemetry configuration file integration has gone smoothly and is now automated . however , when importing commands into <allcaps> ccdd </allcaps> using <allcaps> csv </allcaps> format i have noticed the arg <number> minimum and arg <number> maximum fields , when given column values , seem to stymie importation . it ' s almost certainly isolated to these two fields as i added a custom "" endianness "" field at the end using the table type editor and this was rendered fine into <allcaps> ccdd </allcaps> whenever i deleted any values for arg <number> minimum and arg <number> maximum . any addition of these values causes the entire table to fail to load . i was wondering if you are aware of any outstanding bug . i cannot attach any example files i have been working with as they may contain classified information , but you can e - mail me at <email> if you wish to speak further about this issue . your name did not have an associated e - mail listed with it in the internal global address book ."
"git - based <allcaps> ccdd </allcaps> workflow - request for import / export commands i am looking at using <allcaps> ccdd </allcaps> for a project which utilizes git as its code ' s cm system . the goal is to use <allcaps> ccdd </allcaps> to generate the interface artifacts ( header files , ground system definitions , icds , etc ) using the <allcaps> ccdd </allcaps> scripting interfaces . by git ' s nature , there may be multiple branches of the code which have different versions of an interface and it may be necessary to generate the interface artifacts for a particular branch . can you suggest how to best utilize <allcaps> ccdd </allcaps> in this scenario ? my understanding is that the import / export when using the <allcaps> json </allcaps> and <allcaps> csv </allcaps> formats is lossless ( ie , its an exact definition of the database ) . my thought is to export the <allcaps> ccdd </allcaps> database and commit that to the git branch it describes . when a developer needs to make an interface change to a particular branch they ' d import the database from that branch into <allcaps> ccdd </allcaps> , make the change , generate their artifacts , and then export the database and commit the new version of the database to their branch . i believe this workflow offers the best of both worlds . <repeated> managing the interface definition with the code that it represents while utilizing <allcaps> ccdd </allcaps> as the editing interface ( to maintain database consistency ) and leveraging it ' s scripting interfaces to generate the required artifacts . i do not currently see a way to automate importing and exporting databases . <repeated> this workflow could be almost entirely automated if the <allcaps> ccdd </allcaps> executable supported an ' import ' and ' export ' command which provided similar functionality to the respective dialogs . is this something that is on the development roadmap ? thanks"
"isstructureshared returns true for structure with only one parent i am not sure if i am misunderstanding the documentation for the isstructureshared method , or if there is a bug with the implementation . the documentation for isstructureshared states : "" determine if the specified structure is referenced by more than one parent structure "" . in my database , i have a structure ' prihdr ' which is a field in ' tlmhdr ' which is a field in multiple other structures . prihdr only has one parent ( tlmhdr ) whereas tlmhdr has many parents , however isstructureshared returns true for both . i also have a structure ' testdata ' which is a field in ' testpkt ' . testpkt has no parents and testdata only has testpkt as a parent . as expected , isstructureshared returns false for both . the current implementation appears to determine if a structure has multiple root tables as ancestors , not multiple parents ( based on the terminology defined in section <number> . <number> ) . it would be helpful to clarify the documentation so that its consistent with the definitions earlier in the guide . my application is that i am attempting to generate a database for <allcaps> cosmos </allcaps> ( <url> for data structures which are utilized within multiple packets , they recommend defining the structure once in a separate file and using render ( <url> to include in where needed in the packet definition . only in the case that a structure has multiple parents is it necessary to create a new file , which i was attempting to use isstructureshared to detect . in this application , its undesirable to detect if a structure has multiple ancestors because it only needs to be placed in a separate file if it has multiple parents . if isstructureshared is not the appropriate method to detect a single parent , could you suggest an alternative method ?"
