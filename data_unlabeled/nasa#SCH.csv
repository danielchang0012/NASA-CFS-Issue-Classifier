"update the <allcaps> sch </allcaps> codebase to a more recent cfs revision ( <date> ) hello , we learned that the <allcaps> sch </allcaps> codebase had not been updated since <date> , so we updated it to have it at least compile with our customized cfs build system . we hope that this work will help someone like us to get to a working <allcaps> sch </allcaps> faster . if there was any interest in integrating this work , we would be happy to resolve any issues with this patch . before doing any integration , we would highly recommend setting up clang format for <allcaps> sch </allcaps> , using the <code> from the parent cfs repository . with the formatting in place , it would be much easier to work with the needed diffs . this contribution is made on behalf of reflex aerospace gmbh ( berlin ) where i am employed as a software engineer . - - - this changeset contains <percent> + fixes that are needed to have this <allcaps> sch </allcaps> working against the more recent cfs setup as of <date> . the cfs revision that this is compiled against : 1 9 2 f2ea3061bfe722b8ed1d72b7adecbf36d4f6e <url> known issues : - the changeset contains minor formatting issues but i am deciding to ignore them because the <allcaps> sch </allcaps> itself needs to be clang formatted and i did not find an existing . clang - format in the repository . - this changeset does not touch anything related to setting up the table files in the cmake build system . there are other patches that are attempting to fix those issues : <url> - we are still reworking the <allcaps> sch </allcaps> codebase to fit our needs , so it may be that a few lines were missed and they will not compile ."
