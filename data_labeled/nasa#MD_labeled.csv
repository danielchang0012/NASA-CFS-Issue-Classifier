apps should use cfe_msg_ptr macro instead of cast or local unwrapping apps typically cast to a cfe_msg_message_t or use * . msg . better to use abstracted cfe_msg_ptr . <allcaps> note </allcaps> - not backwards compatible with caelum so recommend not addressing in draco . imported from <allcaps> gsfccfs </allcaps> - <number>,2
md - consider reporting number of addresses being collected in md3001 typically md3000 will need to have a fixed total size of bytes such that the creation of the message ( md3001 ) will result in the same size . that means md3001 item c ) number of bytes sampled will typically always be the same on systems that required fixed size telemetry packets ( assuming a database change is not made every time a new table is needed ) and the address count will always be the max number of entries . consider <allcaps> fsw </allcaps> update to report the actual used address count ( those with nonzero byte counts ) . imported from <allcaps> gsfccfs </allcaps> - <number>,2

"md - table configuration is not consistent with other applications md currently gets the dwell tables from the <allcaps> cds </allcaps> or zeros them out . the md table design is not consistent with other cfs applications : - the md task should allow the option to save or not save tables in the <allcaps> cds </allcaps> ( and therefore behave like the other applications ) . - the md task should allow the option to have default tables in <allcaps> eeprom </allcaps> ( and therefore behave like the other applications ) . - the default address to be used , should a table not be found , should be user defined . <number> may not be a valid address . - the md task does not use the cfe_tbl_manage feature . imported from <allcaps> gsfccfs </allcaps> - <number>",0
