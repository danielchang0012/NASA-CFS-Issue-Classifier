Replace exit(1) statements with preferred macro EXIT_FAILURE ,"**Describe the bug**
Use of `exit(1)` (or `exit(0)` for that matter) as input to exit() is less clear and less portable than using the standard macros `EXIT_SUCCESS` and `EXIT_FAILURE`.

**Expected behavior**
Recommend replacing with the more portable and less magic-numbery `EXIT_FAILURE` macro.

Remove explicit file name references in doxygen file comments to avoid warnings,"**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**
File comment without a filename implies the comments apply to the current file.  Adding the file name makes doxygen try to match that file.  The issue is there's multiple files with the same name, so doxygen gets confused unless you add full path.  Really it's just overhead since the point is to comment the current file.

Sample warning if you `make doc` from the bundle:
```
/home/jhageman/cFS/cFS-GitHub/osal/src/os/posix/src/os-impl-binsem.c:22: warning: the name `os-impl-binsem.c' supplied as the second argument in the \file statement matches the following input files:
   /home/jhageman/cFS/cFS-GitHub/osal/src/os/posix/src/os-impl-binsem.c
   /home/jhageman/cFS/cFS-GitHub/osal/src/os/rtems/src/os-impl-binsem.c
   /home/jhageman/cFS/cFS-GitHub/osal/src/os/vxworks/src/os-impl-binsem.c
Please use a more specific name by including a (larger) part of the path!
```

**Describe the solution you'd like**
Easiest to just remove the name since for every case the comment applies to the current file

"Fix #48, Implement Coding Standard in CodeQL","**Describe the contribution**
Fix #48 
Added the duplicate jobs action to avoid duplicate jobs from running. Added a separate job for coding standard queries. Created two configuration files, one for default queries and security queries and another for jpl rules. Removed push on main branch so when users push code to their forked repos, the workflow runs. Added main branch to pull request, so CodeQL runs on pull request made in the main branch. This is the same logic used in the cFS bundle repo. 

**Testing performed**
Testing done on cFE forked repository, ArielSAdamsNASA/cFE which used the same files, but with different configuration paths.

Jobs were failing when the entire path of the configuration file were not used. Have to use nasa/cFE/.github/codeql/config-name@branch-name. The branch must be included in the path. 

The CodeQL analysis workflow will fail for this PR since it is calling for a configuration file in main the main branch. It will not work until the configuration files are merged into main. 

In the screenshot is the same workflow as in this pull request, but the configuration path is changed to the forked repo and tested branch.

**Expected behavior changes**
There should be one job for security queries and one job for JPL and MISRA queries. 

**Describe alternatives you've considered**
Can allow all branches to run CodeQL for pull requests as seen in cFE and PSP instead of just the main branch like cFS.

CodeQL does not use JPL rules, which is used in the upcoming coding standard.

Implement JPL rules for CodeQL. Continue using the security queries, but keep them separate from the JPL results. Can use two different workflows, one for the coding standard and one for the security queries.

Might be able to use one workflow, as long as the results can be easily identified as a coding standard issue or security issue.

"Fix #43, Add Testing Tools to the Security Policy","**Describe the contribution**
Fix #73
Updated the Security Policy to include the type of testing done for elf2cfetbl under a new section titled ""Testing"". Provided a disclaimer that under the Apache license, liability is not provided.

Add Testing Tools to the Security Policy,"**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**
Users are unaware of how cFS/tblCRCTool is tested. By providing this information, transparency is provided to the community which promotes trust. 

**Describe the solution you'd like**
The security policy should inform users what tools are being used to test cFS/tblCRCTool while being cautious of liability issues. To do so, we can state explicitly that our software does not provide liability under the Apache license. The security policy should inform users that they may view the LGTM results. The policy would state that the alerts from LGTM may not be accurate, since they cannot be dismissed.  

Add that security report should be emailed.

Incorrect EOF check,"**Describe the bug**
The end-of-file test in this tool is incorrect:

https://github.com/nasa/tblCRCTool/blob/b02864ba56b12e00ab152225e3e8f9d6c039d48c/cfe_ts_crc.c#L139

POSIX says that `read()` returns 0 at EOF.  Returning a size less than the requested size (but more than 0) does not mean EOF.

**To Reproduce**
A mainly pedantic issue, this check as it is will probably work on regular files, but it might fail of someone tries to make this work on a pipe or something like that.

**Expected behavior**
Should check if `read()` returned 0, not 100.

**System observed on:**
Code review

**Additional Context**
While we are at it we should change the hardcoded `100` to be `sizeof(buffer)` too.

This does implicitly restrict this tool to the CFE build environment where these headers (common_types.h, cfe_fs_extern_typedefs,h, and cfe_tbl_extern_typedefs.h) are available.  As a result this will no longer be buildable as a fully standalone/external tool.  Based on https://github.com/nasa/tblCRCTool/issues/3#issuecomment-530856962 this is intended/acceptable but I figured it was worth noting again.

2. Followed standard build instructions
3. Executed cfe_ts_crc from build/exe/host with no input, observed:
```
cFE TS CRC calculator for LRO files.
Usage: cfe_ts_crc [filename]
```
4. Executed cfe_ts_crc on random file observed:
```
Table File Name:            cmdUtil
Table Size:                 25684 Bytes
Expected TS Validation CRC: 0xFFFFC2E8

Add a CMakeLists.txt file for the tblCRCTool,"**Describe the contribution**
This allows it to be tied into the main CFE mission build
and correctly reference the same header files as the FSW does.

Fixes #10

**Testing performed**
Built a CFE mission per the default/sample scripts

**Expected behavior changes**
cfe_ts_crc executable is now present in the ""host"" directory after install

**System(s) tested on:**
Ubuntu 18.04 (64-bit)

tblCRCTool needs a CMakeLists.txt file implemented,"**Describe the bug**
This tool is not built like the rest of them, still using a one-off Makefile.

**To Reproduce**
Build CFE using the recommended CMake practice.  This tool is not built.  The user must then manually build the tool within the source directory.

**Expected behavior**
The tool should be built as part of the overall mission build and installed to the ""host"" directory.

Fixes #1, fixes #2 

**Testing performed**
Steps taken to test the contribution:
1. Checked out http://github.com/nasa/cFS rc-6.7.0 and followed setup instructions
2. Followed standard build instructions
3. Make in tblCRCTool directory (no build warnings observed)
4. Executed cfe_ts_crc with no input, observed:
```
