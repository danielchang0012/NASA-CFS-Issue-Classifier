**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**
To match the patterns used in CFE and other modules, all CMD/TLM message definitions should put the content (non-header) parts into a separate struct called ""Payload"".

**Describe the solution you'd like**
Separate message content into a sub structure called ""Payload"".

**Additional context**
This is benefit to tooling that can use the presence of this field to identify where the actual content starts (e.g. something like `offsetof(MsgType, Payload)` would work and be correct, as opposed to checking `sizeof(CFE_MSG_CommandHeader_t)` which may not actually reflect where the content starts due to possible compiler-added padding between them).

**Describe the bug**
A few functions in `md_dwell_tbl.c` use multiple `status`/`result` variables which can be combined into one.

**Code snips**
Example:

The result of `GetAddressResult` is just assigned to `Status` anyway, so they can be combined without any change to the functional behavior.

**Expected behavior**
Simplify code by removing unnecessary `status`/`result` variables.

* [x] I performed a cursory search to see if the bug report is relevant, not redundant, nor in conflict with other tickets.

**Describe the bug**
While compiling the latest version of MD with unit tests enabled, my build environment gave me the following error:
```
error: 'MD_UpdateTableSignature' accessing 32 bytes in a region of size 13 [-Werror=stringop-overflow=]
```

**Code snips**
The bug relates to this line and a few others with the same variable used for testing MD signatures. It seems as though the compiler does not like that ```newsignature``` is implicitly a 13 byte string as opposed to a 32 byte string, which is what the function ```MD_UpdateTableSignature(uint16 TableIndex, char NewSignature[MD_SIGNATURE_FIELD_LENGTH])``` expects
https://github.com/nasa/MD/blob/87e0c1f70858a0d174ce0a11eb8f3f272752efaf/unit-test/md_dwell_tbl_tests.c#L1117

For now, simply explicitly using the size of the array in the variable definition seems to work successfully.
```
char   newsignature[MD_SIGNATURE_FIELD_LENGTH] = ""newsignature"";
```

Quotes should be replaced with angle brackets in #include statements that reside in the /inc location. This will ensure that the preprocessor selects the files pre-designated to override the default files contained within the open source cFS build release - as opposed to selecting those located in the same directory.

**Describe the contribution**
Fixes #39 
Note: all are local variables only.
In order of the errors reported in the issue report:

md_cmds.c
In the `MD_ProcessStartCmd()` function:
`int32 Status = CFE_SUCCESS;`: `Status` only has a single use (on line 88) and it is assigned a value prior to this (on line 87), so this can safely be changed from an initialization to a declaration-only.
`uint16 TableIndex = 0;`: `TableIndex` is assigned a value (on line 80) before any and all of its references.

In the `MD_ProcessStopCmd()` function:
`int32 Status = CFE_SUCCESS;`: `Status` is assigned a value (on line 155) and is used only once on the next line. Given that this is a `void` function, there is no issue with this value being returned uninitialized if it doesn't get set somehow during the function logic or anything like that.
`uint16 TableIndex = 0;`: `TableIndex` is assigned a value (on line 146) before any and all of its references, so this can safely be converted from an initialization to a declaration-only at the top of the function.

In the `MD_ProcessJamCmd()` function:
`int32 Status = CFE_SUCCESS;`: `Status` is used twice in this function and is assigned a value both times on the immediately preceding line (on line 261, and later on line 358).
`MD_DwellControlEntry_t *DwellEntryPtr = 0;`: `DwellEntryPtr` is just initialized to `0`, so can't be used in this state anyway. Its variables are actually assigned values on line 246 and both of its uses are after this line and covered by it.
`uint16 EntryIndex = 0;`: `EntryIndex` is only used inside the if block which starts on line 241, and is assigned a value prior to any and all of its references on line 244.

In the `MD_ProcessSignatureCmd()` function:
`int32 Status = CFE_SUCCESS;`: `Status` is only used once (on line 458) and is assigned a value on the line immediately before this use.

md_dwell_pkt.c
`int32 Result = 0;`: `Result` is only used once (on line 86), and is assigned a value on the immediately preceding line.
`uint16 EntryIndex = 0;`: `EntryIndex` is assigned a value (on line 81) before any and all of its references.
`uint16 NumDwellAddresses = 0;`: `NumDwellAddresses` is assigned a value (on line 50) before any and all of its references.

md_dwell_tbl.c
`int32 Status = CFE_SUCCESS;`: `Status` is assigned a value (on line 192) and is only used in the mutually exclusive `if`/`else` block which immediately follows this assignment.

md_utils.c
`int32 OS_Status = OS_SUCCESS;`: `OS_Status` is only used once (on line 216) and is assigned a value on the immediately preceding line.

**Describe the bug**
Copy of https://github.com/nasa/cFE/issues/2175
After finding that there were 9 different Event IDs to indicate the same thing (Invalid Message ID) in https://github.com/nasa/CF/issues/262, I scrubbed the other common commands (e.g. Task Initialisation [INIT], NOOP, Reset Counters etc.) and found the same issue there - almost every component/app had their own variation of the Event ID name for the exact same event.

**Expected behavior**
Apply consistent Event ID names to the events which are common to all/most components and apps.

**Describe the contribution**
Fixes #34
Removes redundant and inconsistent comments (e.g. `/* end of function */`, `/* end if */`, function name in function header comments).
There were also a few cases of unnecessary empty lines (e.g. on the last line before the closing brace of a function) and also missing empty lines (e.g. between functions) which were corrected. Some of these empty lines trigger the CI format checks.
I've left the commits separated for now to make life easier for whoever reviews this. I can squash them if/when this is ready for merge.

**Testing performed**
None (comment and whitespace changes only).

**Expected behavior changes**
No impact on behavior.
These updates will reduce clutter and inconsistency in the code, improving readability.

* [x] I reviewed the [Contributing Guide](https://github.com/nasa/cFS/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).
* [x] I performed a cursory search to see if the bug report is relevant, not redundant, nor in conflict with other tickets.

**Describe the bug**
Copy of https://github.com/nasa/to_lab/issues/68 and https://github.com/nasa/sample_app/issues/111
There are quite a few redundant comments in the code, such as:
- `/* end of function */`-type comments
- `/* end if */`-type comments
- function header comments which include the function name

Another minor issue has to do with empty lines:
a) _unnecessary_ empty lines (e.g. first line after the opening brace of a function/struct, or the last line before the closing brace - the latter apparently sometimes triggers the CI format checks).
b) _missing_ empty lines between functions (i.e. closing brace of last function, then next function beginning on the immediately next line without an empty line in between)

The unnecessary empty lines (at the beginning or end of a function, for example) represent a low single-digit percentage of the cases (the vast majority of functions/structs do not have these extra empty lines), so there is an argument to remove them purely for consistency, not just due to them being redundant and triggering the CI format checks.

**Expected behavior**
Remove redundant comments to reduce clutter and inconsistency in the code, and improve readability.

Apps should use CFE_MSG_PTR macro instead of cast or local unwrapping,"Apps typically cast to a CFE_MSG_Message_t or use *.Msg.  Better to use abstracted CFE_MSG_PTR. NOTE - Not backwards compatible with Caelum so recommend not addressing in Draco.

MD - consider reporting number of addresses being collected in MD3001,"Typically MD3000 will need to have a fixed total size of bytes such that the creation of the message (MD3001) will result in the same size.  That means MD3001 item c) number of bytes sampled will typically always be the same on systems that required fixed size telemetry packets (assuming a database change is not made every time a new table is needed) and the address count will always be the max number of entries.

Consider FSW update to report the actual used address count (those with nonzero byte counts).

MD - Table Configuration is Not Consistent with Other Applications,"MD currently gets the dwell tables from the CDS or zeros them out. The MD table design is not consistent with other cFS applications:
- The MD task should allow the option to save or not save tables in the CDS (and therefore behave like the other applications). 
- The MD task should allow the option to have default tables in EEPROM (and therefore behave like the other applications). 
- The default address to be used, should a table not be found, should be user defined. 0 may not be a valid address. 
- The MD task doesn't use the CFE_TBL_Manage feature.
