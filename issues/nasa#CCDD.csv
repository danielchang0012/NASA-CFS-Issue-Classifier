CSV File Import Failure,"When trying to import CSV files through the command line and GUI, the files fail to fully import. The CSV files have been created by C_struct_to_CSV_conversion, and the issues seem to stem around structs that have arrays as parameters.

### Command Line
Structs in the CSV file will import properly up until the first struct to contain an array. Once a struct with an array is reached, a table will be created for it but no data will be imported. Any structs in the file listed afterwards will not be imported at all.

The following examples are errors that have appeared when attempting to import a CSV file through the command line: 
> CCDD : Invalid Input : Invalid characters in table 'CS_TableNameCmd_t' for column 'Array Size'; characters consistent with input type 'Array index' expected

> CCDD : Invalid Input : Index: 13, Size: 13

The command used: 
`$ java -jar CCDD_beta.jar -project myproject -host localhost -user myuser -password mypassword -import 'importFileType CSV -filename myfile' -shutdown`

### GUI
When attempting to import through the GUI,  a table is created for each struct. However, with structs containing arrays, all parameters will be imported up to the array itself and any parameters afterwards fail to import. Structs without arrays are imported normally.

Example data for an import:

Actual import:

Error when exporting XTCE files from command line,"When attempting to export XTCE files from the command line, the following error occurs:

```

EDS Format?,"This is more of a question than an issue.

The EDS export appears to refer to the CCSDS standard: <DataSheet xmlns=""http://www.ccsds.org/schema/sois/seds"" ... >
But the format does not comply with the current version of the Blue Book: [CCSDS 876.0-B-1](https://public.ccsds.org/Pubs/876x0b1.pdf) 
Most notably, the <Namespace> element is not in that spec, and it doesn't appear to handle PackageFile and Package elements.

I'm new to this, so maybe I'm using it wrong.
I'm trying to use CCDD to import/export EDS files compatible with:
https://github.com/jphickey/cfe-eds-framework
as embedded in:
https://github.com/OpenSatKit/cfsat/

The cfsat project does not have any DataSheet EDS documents, just packages, and CCDD doesn't like those files. 

Is there some other tool that is being used to convert CCDD generated XTCE or EDS file into a cFS build?",,https://github.com/nasa/CCDD/issues/96
Export Full DB and Import to New Project Fails (CSV and JSON),"**Version:**
![version](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/101198782/157273928-bc15535b-9906-4326-9db8-c4c773d8e45b.PNG)
Git commit: f58e1f4b6ce12d2d2 Version 2.0.29.  Added back Halt dialog...

**Expected:**
If I export a full database in CSV or JSON, I expect to be able to create a new project, import the file, and restore the database to the same state without errors.

**Result:**
Using CSV files, there are errors that result in the new project being different than the original database.
Using JSON files, the import fails completely.

**Steps:**
1. Create and open a new project
2. Run through the steps in the tutorial (except the CSV table import) to create a project with macros and structures and commands
3. Export to CSV with 'Export Full Database' and 'Single File' and select all Tables. Full settings shown below.

[Step3.csv](https://github.com/nasa/CCDD/files/8207512/tutorial.csv)
4. Repeat export with JSON using same settings.
[tutorial.json.txt](https://github.com/nasa/CCDD/files/8207546/tutorial.json.txt)
5. Create and open a new project for CSV Import.
6. Import the CSV file generated in Step 3 and check 'Importing and Entire Database'
7. The following errors are seen:

Cannot Import/Export EDS/XTCE,"Hello,

I was able to complete the tutorial (thank you again for the help with #93) and am now trying to interface CCDD with my cFS repository.

I first attempted to import a provided EDS from the cFS repo, [base_types.xml](https://github.com/nasa/cFE/blob/b66661cc6e8f695d5ca9fa56217f58a291d5884d/modules/core_api/eds/base_types.xml), which resulted in nothing happening. I can see in logs it attempts to import but I do not get any indication of errors. (Note: I tried with both .xml and .eds extensions)
```
localhost:5432|cFS|tstern|11/10/2021 09:56:20.453|Status|Importing table(s) from '/home/tstern/NASA/cFS/cfe/fsw/cfe-core/eds/base_types.eds'

localhost:5432|cFS|tstern|11/10/2021 09:56:20.454|Command|SELECT * FROM __groups ORDER BY OID;
```
I see the exact same behavior when trying to import XTCE as well.

Trying to export XTCE or EDS, I do not get any output to logs at all and no indication of a failure. 

C_Headers and CSV both work without issue on import/export. I have not tested JSON import but export works there as well.

I did notice that the default schema locations in the Preferences->Other tab for both XTCE and EDS were 404 links so I updated those to live xsd pages which could be part of my issue if I did incorrectly. For reference I used ""https://www.omg.org/spec/XTCE/20180204/SpaceSystem.xsd"" as my XTCE xsd. 

I also noticed this is very similar to the behavior seen in #91

I would greatly apricate any and all help and am happy to assist in whatever way possible.

Missing Primitive Data Types,"Still working through the provided tutorial. 

I got to step 3.5.1, where you have to select a primitive data type for your new variable; however I do not have any data types available in my tool.

Going to manage data types also shows no available data types, primitive or otherwise. 

Do we have to create the primitive data types by hand or should they be automatically populated?

If populated, is that something I might have missed during the install or maybe a misplaced environment variable that could be causing this?

Any and all help is greatly appreciated. Thank you.",,https://github.com/nasa/CCDD/issues/93
"Invalid SQL command; ERROR: syntax error at or near ""OIDS"" when opening project","Hello,

- CCDD: 2.0.27 (10-1-2021)
- PostGreSQL: 12.8  *** JDBC: PostgreSQL 9.4.1207.jre7 

After doing some digging it appears that the use of OIDS was removed in version 12 of PostGreSQL. I will roll back and try again. Apologies if this is already documented somewhere.

Problems exporting and importing XTCE,"Hello,

First of all, thank you for creating this tool. We are evaluating CCDD in combination with COSMOS and NASA cFS.

At this point, we are running CCDD from `CCDD.jar` and also we have set up running CCDD from Intellij IDEA (we can step through the code with a debugger). The commit is f1641de.

**Problem 1: Importing and exporting XTCE does not work when running CCDD from jar**

- We take an XTCE example from the `CCDD-2/Docs/CCDD_Users_Guide.pdf` (page 200).
- We save the XTCE content to an .xtce file.
- We open the CCDD program and try to import the file via ""Data / Import data / XTCE"".
- We select the file and click ok.
- The dialog disappears and then nothing happens in the user interface, nothing is printed to the message log except:

> Importing table(s) from `.../guide.xtce`

- We see no tables in the `Data / Edit table(s)`

The exporting does not work - after we click ok on the Export dialog - the dialog box closes and nothing happens (file is not created, no log message).

**Problem 2: Running CCDD from IDEA IDE**

- The steps are the same as in the description above but the manifestation is different:
- We are getting an SQL error `CCDD : Database Error : Cannot retrieve TABLE_DATA_VAR_NAMES list`
- The file contents seem to be imported even though we cannot say if the imported data is consistent.

---

We are ready to assist you in the investigation of this issue.

Question about automatic message ID assignments,"Sorry, this isn't really a bug and more of a question. If this isn't the right avenue to ask this, let me know and I will redirect this question to another place.

I'm a bit confused by the Assign IDs functionality. After reading the tutorial, it seems like this functionality gets applied to the ""Message ID"" field. But in reality, this field seems to be the ""Telemetry message name & ID"" and ""Command  name & ID"" fields.

Is there a way to provide a group which represents a CFS application, a message ID prefix. Say I have 2 groups which represent app1 and app2. I want the message IDs for app1 to start with 0x09a and app2 to start with 0x0aa. Is there a way to set prefixes like that for individual groups?

Also what about if I have a structure that I don't want to get an assigned message ID? Should I just put a # in that field to avoid the automatic assignment?",,https://github.com/nasa/CCDD/issues/86
Enum tables are returned by some CcddScriptDataAccessHandler structure table calls,"The newly added Enum tables seem to be included in a couple of the CcddScriptDataAccessHandler calls that return information for Structures, specifically the `getStructureTablesByReferenceOrder` and `getStructureTableNumRows` functions.

I tested this out by doing the following:
1. Updating an existing project to use CCDD v2.0.24
2. Adding a new ENUM table
3. Replacing a row in a structure table to use the new enum table I created.
4. Running the typesHeader.js script that is included in the CCDD scripts folder.


I initially get some errors about variables not existing, but after fixing those errors it includes an empty enum as a structure. This script would need to be updated to handle enum tables, but the `getStructureTablesByReferenceOrder` seems to be returning an enum table along with the other structure tables.

Ensure a Command Argument can be added to a Command,"Inserting a new row in a command and selecting a command argument will
cause an error when storing the changes. This occurs in the function

Unanticipated error when storing a Command Argument on a Command,"### Description
I'm getting an error when I'm attempting to store a new row of a command with a command argument. This seems to be caused by the code looking for a data type column when there is no data type column for the Command type.

I initially saw this on an existing project which I had converted over to CCDD v2, but I have been able to recreate it on a brand new table that uses CCDD v2.

### Version of software
Occurs in CCDD v2 or specifically v2.0.23.

### Exact error message
> An unanticipated error occurred; cause ""Index -1 out of bounds for length 6""

### Steps to Reproduce

1. Create a new table of type ""Command""
2. Create a new table of type ""Structure: Cmd Arg Ref""
3. Edit the ""Command"" table you just created.
4. Click Ins Row to add a new row

C_Struct_To_CSV output cannot be imported in CCDD-2,"I have setup CCDD 2.0 locally on a system here, and am using the
struct parser to parse a cFS project. When I try to import the CSV
files generated in CCDD it fails consistently. I have attached a
sample file and the relevant error log.
This is running against a PostgreSQL 11 instance.

CRITICAL: Filesystem Directory Deletion possible,"I installed CCDD locally on my Linux Desktop, in order to add TLM/CMD data. Then I tried a export it to a file (it was either JSON or CSV, i don't remember) and browsed to my home directory. I forgot to add a filename at the end, and started the operation (my mistake). The app started deleting the contents of my home directory. I'll work on some fixes once my machine is back operational.

Enumerations cannot be used as data types in Structure tables,"This may be more of a feature request than a bug. It would be nice to have the ability to make reference to enumerations as data types for entries in Structure/Command tables in CCDD.

Currently, an error similar to the following occurs if you do so:

CCDD : Database Error : Cannot load table 'MD_CmdHandlerTblRec_t,MD_MsgType_t.MsgTypes'; cause 'Table doesn't exist'
CCDD : Script Error : Cannot execute script '/home/scripts/createHeader.py' using table(s) 'Group:CFS_LIB + Group:CI_LAB + Group:CS + Group:DS + Group:FM + Group:HK + Group:HS + Group:IO_LIB + Group:LC + Group:MD + Group:MM + Group:SAMPLE_APP + Group:SC + Group:SCH + Group:TO_LAB'; cause 'Table 'MD_CmdHandlerTblRec_t' (or one of its children) failed to load'

CCDD v2 doesn't work with Java 11,It's not currently mentioned in the documentation that Java 8 is required for CCDD v2 and newer versions of Java won't work. This should be included somewhere in the readme for the project.,,https://github.com/nasa/CCDD/issues/67

When running CCDD Version Version 1.5.27:

1. When abstract is implemented, it returns:

*Duplicate Table(s)*

Ignored the following duplicate table definitioin(s): CFS_CMD (file: error.xtce)

If both abstract commands in the file include the token then it brings in TestArgument1 and TestArgument2.


2. When BaseMetaCommand is implemented without an empty 'ArgumentAssignmentList' underneath, it returns:

*CCDD Error*

An unanticipated error occurred; cause 'null'

Error trace:

The implementation with an empty 'ArgumentAssignmentList' underneath (while working with the import tool) appears to fail validation when checked against the XTCE 1.1 schema.

Importing XTCE causes project fields to duplicate,"## Description
When importing XTCE that has the XML AncillaryData fields, the project fields are appended regardless of the import options selected. This occurs for every XTCE import, so you can very quickly have a ton of duplicate project fields if you import frequently.

## Versions affected
v1.5.27
v2.0.2

## Steps to reproduce
1. Import an XTCE file (One is provided below)
2. Navigate to `Data > Manage project fields`
3. The project fields are appended even if they are duplicates.

## Example XTCE

CCDD will not start if directory specified by logpath argument doesn't exist,"When attempting to start CCDD with the logpath CLI argument specifying a directory that doesn't exist, CCDD with emit the following error and fail to open:

`Log Error : Cannot create event log file`

I think more user-friendly behavior would be to create the folder if it doesn't exist (or perhaps provide a CLI argument that tells it to create if missing, if that behavior is undesirable for some set of users) and only fail if it cannot create that folder.

* Exporting does not multiply, only the importing does.
* The provided example file was created within CCDD and then exported to XTCE

CCDD returns success when failing to parse import file,"When attempting to import an invalidly-formatted json file, I'm getting the following from CCDD:

```
File Warning : Cannot parse import file 'C:\path\to\my\file.json'; cause 'null'
```

which is expected, however CCDD exits with a return code of 0 (success), which makes it difficult to detect and respond to the error in scripts.",,https://github.com/nasa/CCDD/issues/62
File description in JSON export causes merge conflicts,"The JSON file exported by CCDD contains a `File Description` field which contains a timestamp, username, and project name. The values of these fields tends to change within a distributed development environment and is flagged as a conflict within this file each time it's part of a merge  (requiring the developer to manually resolve the differences in the File Description, even though they don't affect the contents/import of this file).

It would be useful if CCDD provided an option (accessible via at least the CLI) to omit the File Description field from the export.",,https://github.com/nasa/CCDD/issues/61
All javadoc files modified in recent commits,"In some recent commits it appears that every JavaDoc file has changes because the timestamps within them are updated when they're regenerated. This might not be desirable because it makes it harder to identify real changes in the code while examining a particular commit (ex, commit 173775acffc has 691 changes files, almost all of which appear to be JavaDoc timestamp changes).

It looks like JavaDoc supports a `-notimestamp` argument that would omit that timestamp, which should result in only the files containing actual changes containing diffs, making it easier to find real changes in the commits.

logPath argument is the same that I've been using previously and I've confirmed that the folder exists (and is populated with log files from prior versions), so I don't see any reason that it should be unable to create the log file.

Non-existent JSON fields should be default initialized ,"Elements of ['Table Definition'][*]['Table Data'] shouldn't be required to contain all fields not detailed as ""Required"" when loading JSON files. For example, if I provide a definition for 'Description' with:
```
        {
          ""Column Name"": ""Description"",
          ""Enable if Pointer"": true, 
          ""Enable if Structure"": true, 
          ""Required"": false,
          ""Unique"": false 
        }
```
If a description isn't provided within the JSON object for 'Table Data' this should be parsed as either NULL (indicating it wasn't provided) or default initialized (which if it didn't exist in the data, would most likely be it's default value anyway).",,https://github.com/nasa/CCDD/issues/58
Project name case-sensitive in delete subcommand,"CCDD appears to require an all-lowercase version of the project name when using the delete subcommand, as demonstrated below.
```

>java -cp ""C:\Programs\CCDD\CCDD.jar"" CCDD.CcddMain -logPath ""C:\Programs\CCDD\logs""  -delete ""-name 'testcapitals'"" -shutdown

It looks like CCDD may be expecting the database name, rather than the project name, which appears to always be lowercase.

Also, the failed command in the sequence above is not reflected in the log file generated from that session... I only see command and success entries.

Version number in export,"Currently it does not appear that CCDD includes the version from which an export was generated in the resulting file. It would be helpful for debugging changes to the export format (like the ones which changed the ordering with version 1.4.75) on multiple users setups (who are on various versions, depending on when they last pulled) to be able to tell what version the export was derived from. Could just be part of the existing File Description elements.

Changing applicability of field deletes all values,"When changing the applicability of a table field, all values from all existing instances of that field are cleared. This is undesirable and causes unnecessary loss of data.

For example, when a field with scope 'All Tables' is changed to 'Roots Only', the field is (properly) no longer displayed on child tables but the field is also cleared for all root tables, requiring the user to re-enter the values for the root tables (whose field hasn't changed). 

The same happens in the opposite direction. For example, when a field with scope 'Roots Only' is changed to 'All Tables' the field is (properly) created for all child tables and is blank (because it previously didn't exist), however the field is now also blank for all root tables, even though they didn't change.

Macro definitions cleared when running script from CLI,"When running a script via the CLI, I'm observing that all macro definitions are cleared. 

After importing a project which has macro definitions, I'm able to run a script (through the GUI) and generate the artifact without issue. If I close CCDD and re-run that same script via the CLI, when I reopen CCDD the macro definitions are no longer present. The clearing appears to take place before the script is run because scripts which depend on those macros will error.

So far this has been observed on OSX and Linux with v1.4.55. Can provide logs if that's helpful.

Table not removed from group on deletion,"When deleting a table CCDD does not remove the table from any groups of which it was a member, requiring the user to then open the group editor to manually remove it. Failing to do so will cause errors (due to missing tables) when attempting to use that group with scripts in the future.

It would be helpful for CCDD to automatically remove a deleted table from any groups of which it was a part.",,https://github.com/nasa/CCDD/issues/53
Imported table not matching json file,"I'm seeing an issue where the table definition imported by CCDD does not match the table definition in the json file being imported. The json file was created via export from CCDD. This issue is reproduceable through both the CLI and GUI. The log files contains no 'Fail' entries and contains a successful import entry at the end.

As far as I've noticed, this is only affecting one table hierarchy (root and children) in my project right now. I'm not sure what details are relevant here, so here's a description of the table hierarchy in question:

The root table contains several elements, all of which are child tables (no base datatypes). The child tables each have several elements, all of which have descriptions, several of which have units defined, and several of which have enumerations (defined as macros). I see all of these attributes in the exported json file, however when my coworker imports the file, CCDD has only imported the name, data type, and array size of the elements of the each of the tables (root and children). Coincidentally the missing fields are ones that I added recently (which is how this was discovered), but I can't find anything about the contents of these fields that would cause this issue. 

Observed on CCDD 1.4.49 on Windows, Ubuntu, and OSX.",,https://github.com/nasa/CCDD/issues/52
Type-dependent fields not disabled in custom table type,"For an instance of the default structure table type, when a non-integer type is selected for a row, the Bit Length and Enumeration are disabled (grayed out) for that row since they're not meaningful for non-integer types. The same behavior is not observed for custom table types with those same conditions, despite using the same input types for each of those columns... they continue to accept user input.

I'm not sure if this is due to the Structure/Command table types being treated specially or if this is a bug. For consistency, it seems that these input types should behave the same for both default and user-defined table types.",,https://github.com/nasa/CCDD/issues/51
CCDD returns 0 (Success) with database errors,"When I attempt to connect to a project which is already open, I (correctly) get the following error message:

however CCDD still exits with exit code 0 (Success). It would be helpful if it returned a non-zero exit code so that calling program can handle the error. This is a similar issue to #47 where it was noted that CCDD (used to) return 0 on a password authentication failure.",,https://github.com/nasa/CCDD/issues/50
Feature Request: Add table to group during creation,"It would be helpful if the New Table dialog allowed adding the new table to a group during its creation. 

Currently, the process of creating a grouped table requires creating the table (via `Data > New Table`) and then going back into the Data menu to access `Manage Groups` and add the table to a group. 

This process could be streamlined by having a dropdown menu on the New Table dialog which would default to `No Group` (current functionality) but allow the user to select any existing group to automatically add the table to that group.",,https://github.com/nasa/CCDD/issues/49

No feedback with password authentication issue,"When CCDD is started without a user specified, the user is prompted for a database username and password. I'm attempting to setup a new CCDD machine and am stuck at this prompt (ie, username and password are entered, click 'okay', and prompt reappears). I've checked the log and there's only one entry (echoing the arguments CCDD was started with), but nothing relating to a login attempt. 

When I start CCDD with the `user` argument (set to the user I would enter into the dialog) and `shutdown`, I get the following error in the log:
`FATAL: password authentication failed `
I suspect that's the same issue I'm seeing through the GUI, but can't tell without additional feedback from CCDD. It would be very helpful if CCDD could provide more information, preferably through a log message (and a dialog if using the GUI).

Hotkeys in table editing window not responding,"Each button at the bottom of the table editing window and each dropdown menu along the top has a letter underlined, which implies that they're able to be used by hitting that letter as a hotkey. The only place that this works for me is if I've already opened one of the menus at the top (at which point if I hit one of the selected letters it will execute that command). I'm unable to open any of the menus (ex open File by hitting `F`) nor use any of the buttons along the bottom (ex, Store by hitting `S`) via hotkey. 

As far as I can tell, neither case of the letter works nor is it dependent on what I have selected (ie I'm not editing one of the table fields while attempting to use a hotkey). Hitting ctrl and the letter also doesn't activate the hotkey.

The users guide doesn't appear to have any info on these hotkeys (nothing comes up when I search for hotkey or shortcut) so I'm not sure if this is a bug or if I'm misunderstanding how to use the hotkeys. Observed on 1.4.41 on win10.",,https://github.com/nasa/CCDD/issues/46

Inconsistent structure table fields,"My structure table type has a field 'Telemetry message name & ID' with applicability 'Roots Only'.

Unable to delete redundant macro definitions,"I've ended up in a situation where I have duplicate macro definitions (through the import process, though I'm unsure if it may have been my fault). I'm unable to delete any of the duplicate definitions because the gui says that they're referenced by a table (which is true). 

It would be helpful if the import process could merge completely identical macro definitions and either prompt or throw an error for different macro definitions with the same name (to allow the user to sort it out). It would also be helpful for the GUI to allow deleting macros (even if they're referenced by a table) as long as at least one macro with that name still exists.

Installation/configuration on mac,"One of the machines I'm attempting to use CCDD on is a mac (running OSX 10.12.6). We've cloned the CCDD repo and can start CCDD, and have installed Postgres, and CCDD can connect to the database. We're unable to create a CCDD project. When we attempt to create a project through the menu option, several commands are issued, shown below:
```
 Command | SELECT r.rolname FROM pg_catalog.pg_roles r ORDER BY r.rolname ASC;
 Command | SELECT datname \|\| E';' \|\| split_part(description, ';', 2) \|\| E';' \|\| split_part(split_part(description, ';', 1), 'Core Flight Software Command and Data Dictionary', 2) \|\| E';' \|\| substr(description, length(datName \|\| 'Core Flight Software Command and ... (247)
```
On other systems there's a CREATE DATABASE command issued after these two, that we're not observing on the mac. CCDD doesn't seem to issue the command to actually create the database, but also doesn't error or provide any feedback as to what's happening.

If you have any mac users, could they provide more detailed installation/configuration directions? We first tried the postgres installer (https://www.enterprisedb.com/downloads/postgres-postgresql-downloads, version 10.5) but kept getting the error:
```
Problem running post install step … the Database Cluster Initialisation failed
```
We did manually initialize a database (using initdb) and create users, but were unable to get CCDD to create a project.

We then tried the PostgresApp (https://postgresapp.com/) (postgres versions 9.6 and 10.5) but are observing no errors and the same behavior from CCDD.

I'm using groups to organize sets of tables by application to make it easy to execute scripts on the set of tables describing that application.

Feature Request: Command Reference/Table Column Reference Input Type,"Similar to the Variable Reference input type, it would be helpful to have a Command Reference input type for which the valid values are the name of an existing Command Name from a defined Command table. This may be more generally handled by an input type which references a particular column in a particular table type (both defined by the user). It would be helpful if the same autofill that works for the variable reference also worked for this input type to prompt the user with the valid options.

This command reference would be useful for the definition of RTS/ATS tables for which its important that the command the user selects already exists in the database.

Feature Request: Variable Reference validation,"As described in the issue describing its implementation, the variable reference field turns yellow if the reference is not valid (ie, if the referenced variable has changed since the field was selected), which is useful for identifying invalid fields in the table the user is editing. As far as I'm aware, there is currently no way to tell if a change to a structure results in invalid references without opening each table containing a reference and checking for yellow cells.

Feature Request: Numeric input type,"In would be useful to have an input type which only accepts numeric characters and a single optional period. This is similar to the current Floating Point input, however the floating point input will add a trailing decimal even if the user does not enter one. This numeric input type should preserve the user's input with respect if the decimal exists or not. 

The following regex describes the requested validation:
```
\d*\.?\d*

While this can be achieved via the input type editor, this seems like a generic-enough type that it may be worth including by default. I'm looking to use this input type to store literal values of command arguments and variable field, for use in scripts. While it would be ideal to check the value the user entered is consistent with the specified command argument/variable type, I think that ensuring the user enters a numeric value (and preserving what they entered) is sufficient for now.",,https://github.com/nasa/CCDD/issues/29

however, the module imported (CcddScriptDataAccessHandler) doesn't appear to be used in any of the scripts. Further, the `ccdd` variable appears to be defined by default no matter if the import is used or not. The script shown here:
```
with open(""init.txt"",""w"") as file:
    file.write("","".join(dir()))
    file.write(""\n"")
    file.write(str(ccdd))
    file.write(""\n"")
    file.write(ccdd.getScriptName())
```

produces the following output:
```
__builtins__,ccdd,ccdds,file
CCDD.CcddScriptDataAccessHandler@3c874e39
C:\myCCDDpath\CCDD\scripts\testImport.py
```
and demonstrates that the variables ccdd and ccdds are created without the need for the import.

Could you clarify the purpose of the CcddScriptDataAccessHandler import? 

Additionally, could you provide details on how to import the ccdd variable into other user-provided modules? Some of my scripts have reached a size where it would be preferable to organize them in multiple files, but I haven't been able to figure out what I need to import in the support files to have access to the same ccdd variable that the main script gets automatically. 

It would be much preferable to be able to use something like 
```
from CCDD.CcddScriptHandler import accessHandler as ccdd
```
and be able to use it in any module called by the script than to have the ccdd variable defined implicitly only in the main script. From my (limited) knowledge of jython, the above statement would work if accessHandler was a public variable in the CcddScriptHandler class and would provide the same ccdd variable as currently defined.

Changes to input type definitions don't take effect until reapplied,"When designing my own input type field for a column with an enumerated value (ie a set of 'Valid Selections), I noticed that changing the definition of an input field doesn't seem to take effect until that custom input type is reapplied to the column.

Steps to reproduce:

1. Define a custom input datatype with values in the Valid Selections column via the input types editor, store changes
2. Apply that custom input type to a column via the table type editor, store changes
3. Open a table which uses that column, and confirm that the 'Valid Selections' are listed in a dropdown menu and are selectable
4. Back in the input types editor, add additional Valid Selections, store the changes
5. Open same table again, dropdown with Valid Selections doesn't appear, input field appears to just be a standard text input which will accept any value
6. In table type editor, assign that column to any built-in input type, store changes
7. Then, assign column back to custom input type, store changes
8. While editing table, once again able to again see and select from the Valid Selections dropdown

Method to terminate script execution,"Most of the built-in scripts provide some form of error checking in the main program (ex: checking structure rows exist) and use the showErrorDialog() method to present the error to the user. The flow control in those scripts appear to have been engineered such that showErrorDialog is called just before the script exits, however, for complicated scripts there can be error checking which is not easy to structure in this manner (ex: error checking values of structure columns which are not accessible until much later in the program). 

It would be useful to have a way to cancel/terminate execution of the current script via the API. At least in jython, I've tried using a return statement and sys.exit to terminate the script with no luck.

This give script-writers the ability to decide if an error is recoverable and if not just inform the user and terminate the script, rather than having the user sit through and acknowledge any additional errors during the remaining execution.",,https://github.com/nasa/CCDD/issues/25

Feature Request: Methods to query global structure tables,"According to the documentation, the getStructureTableNumRows() scripting method is intended to return the number of rows in the structure table. In the built-in scripts this method is used to get the structure rows for the tables passed as arguments to the current script execution. It might be helpful to clarify this in the documentation (ie, that this methods does not returns the global number of structure rows, just the ones passed to the script). 

It would be helpful to have script methods which are capable of querying the whole database, rather than just the elements passed to the script. This could be achieved either via specialized methods or optional arguments to existing methods.

I'm prototyping generating cFS HK tables via a custom table type which includes the name/path of the variables (in the CCDD database) which should be included in a particular HK-generated packet. Using the variable name to retrieve the Message ID and Byte Offset via scripts requires access to the rest of the database, which can currently only be achieved by calling the script on every available structure table. Global database query methods (and input validations such as issue #21) enable workflows in which tables refer to other elements in the database (such as for Limit Checker and HK tables).

Identifiers in invalid column import error message,"Currently if a file being imported contains an invalid array size specification (specifically invalid characters, in my case) an error is issued saying so, however that error message does not contain the location the invalid definition was encountered, making it difficult to track down. It would be useful if the error message contained some identifier (line number, table name, field name, etc) to more quickly locate the problem in the file being imported.

Thanks!",,https://github.com/nasa/CCDD/issues/22
Feature Request: Input datatype for existing structure rows,"It would be useful to have a input data type which validated that the input is a structure row which already exists in the database. The use case is for defining data products which depend on existing definitions (or properties of those definitions) in the database, such as:

-  defining CCDD table types which describe CFS limit checker tables. Limit checker tables define the value to be checked in terms of the apid and packet offset, both of which are already available from CCDD given a valid structure row. 
- defining CCDD table types which describe CFS HK tables. HK tables define the value to place in a new packet by Apid and packet offset, similar to above.

Having the entry field validate the entry is an existing row in the database greatly simplifies the error checking necessary in the scripts to generate these products.

As a user-convenience feature, it would also be great if the input field could prompt/autocomplete a user typing the name/path of the mnemonic to make it easier to enter this data.

Thanks for the consideration.",,https://github.com/nasa/CCDD/issues/21
Feature Request: Enumerated Value input type,"It would be useful to have an enumerated input type to constrain user inputs to one of a set of predefined values, preferably via a drop-down menu of options. This would be distinct from the current `Enumerated` input type, which is simply validated as an alphanumeric field.

I'm looking at tracking CFS event messages via a custom table type and need to track the event type (which is either 'Debug', 'Info', 'Error', or 'Critical'). It would be useful to have an input type which could validate the input is one of the items in a list of acceptable values. Otherwise, an unacceptable input cannot be caught until a script which depends on that value runs and throw an error.

Another potential use case may be in defining CFS limit tracker watchpoints where the user must select one of a pre-defined list of operations to be performed (LessThan, EqualTo, GreaterThan, etc) by the watchpoint.

MsgIDs applied to non-root tables,"When using the Message IDs > Assign IDs menu to apply message IDs to structure tables, Message IDs are applied to all structure tables, not just root tables. This results in child tables being assigned Message IDs.

Structure tables (by default) have two fields, `Telemetry Message ID` and `Telemetry Message ID Name`. These fields have applicability set to `Root Only`. This setting seems to control whether the Data > Edit Tables editor displays the Message ID field for editing. It seems like the Assign IDs menu should respect the Root Only setting of that field.
",,https://github.com/nasa/CCDD/issues/19
Fields with boolean type not displayed as check box,"When adding custom columns to the default structure table, the user's guide indicates that a check box will be used to represent boolean fields when editing tables. In practice a text field is present to the user which only accepts `true` or `false`. This works, but doesn't appear to be consistent with the user guide and results in having to handle an additional option (true, false, or empty) in script logic.

In built-in tables such as the Table Type Editor, the Unique and Required fields do correctly display as check boxes, so perhaps just user-defined fields are not being formatted?

Execute command output path subcommand,"The scriptOutPath command is provided to control the placement of files created by scripts via the command line interface (CLI), which works as intended, however that command also changes the output path for users interacting with CCDD via the GUI (which may not be desirable).

To support workflows in which CCDD is used both as an editing/development interface (via the GUI) and as a data producer (via the CLI), it would be desirable to be able to set the output of scripts for a particular session, which wouldn't affect later GUI users. Currently, if scripts are called in between GUI sessions the output path may have unexpectedly (to the GUI user) changed.

Additionally, the CLI supports multiple execute commands, which effectively means that all outputs from a given session must be placed in a single output directory. This may be undesirable if several scripts producing different output are called during a single CCDD command. 

It would be useful if the execute command took (an optional) subcommand allowing the specification of a path which overrides the CCDD global script output path set by setOutPath for a particular execute command. This allows organization of the outputs of multiple script calls and allows CLI users to execute CCDD scripts without modifying the state of CCDD, which may be confusing for GUI users. This would maintain the current functionality of scriptOutPath command but also support the points above. This also mirrors the functionality of the filePath subcommand of the export command.

Export does not export macro definitions ,"The current export format (at least for CSV and JSON) does not contain a definition of the project macros. The dialog contains an option to substitute macro values for macro names, however this doesn't preserve the definition of the macro.

I'm using macros to define and ensure that enumeration values stay in sync. For example, if two packets telemeter the same type of enumeration, its desirable to have a single definition for that enumeration to eliminate the possibility of them accidentally being defined differently. This is achievable via macros (ie, define a macro containing the definition of the enumeration and then use the macro in the enumeration field of both table rows), however the value of the enumeration is not exported unless the substitute option has been checked, in which case the single definition of both enumerations is lost when imported.

I think it would be useful to export the definition of the macro if the substitute option is not selected (so that the user has access to the macro values) and to import macro definitions if found in the file being imported.

Methods of inspecting script values at runtime,"It would be very useful to be able to inspect values within CCDD scripts at runtime, which I don't believe is currently possible. This capability could be utilized for script development/debugging and could also be used for archiving the status/state/results of scripts beyond the success/fail that is currently logged.

Exposing a method in the scripting API to allow writing a message to the CCDD log file may be one way to provide this capability. Its currently possible to write short strings to the showErrorDialog/showWarningDialog methods, but dismissing those dialogs requires user interaction and does not appear to result in a log entry.

Longer stack trace for errors in scripts,"The error handling for the scripting interface only logs the top of the stack trace, which complicates script debugging.

The following are an examples of error messages printed to the log upon encountering an error in a script:

```
localhost:5432|myProject|myUser|06/18/2018 12:18:58.002|Fail|Cannot execute script 'C:\my\path\to\script\myScript.py' using table(s) 'Group:myGroup'; cause 'script file 'C:\my\path\to\script\myScript.py' error 'TypeError: 'str' object is not callable in <script> at line number 432''
```
```
localhost:5432|myProject|myUser|06/18/2018 12:22:08.366|Fail|Cannot execute script 'C:\my\path\to\script\myScript.py' using table(s) 'Group:myGroup'; cause 'script file 'C:\my\path\to\script\myScript.py' error 'AttributeError: 'array.array' object has no attribute 'length' in <script> at line number 432''
```

In both cases the error is reported as having occurred on line 432, which (for this script) is the top-level parent function in the call stack in which the error occurred. In my case, this is a large helper function which implements the entire algorithm and these errors occurred in two different child functions, which can be complicated to track down. It would be very helpful to log longer/deeper stack traces.

execute interprets absolute path as association name,"For robustness against where the user runs and/or places CCDD on their machine, I'd like to use absolute paths. When attempting to specify an absolute path to the script file, as shown in the command below:

```java -cp C:\My\Absolute\CCDD\Path\CCDD.jar CCDD.CcddMain -logPath C:\My\Absolute\Log\Path -project myProject -user myUser -password #### -execute 'C:\My\Absolute\Script\Path\myScript.js:Group:myGroup' -scriptOutPath C:\My\Absolute\Out\Path```

I get the error:
`CCDD : Database Error : Unrecognized association name 'C'`

at the command line. It appears that it may be parsing the colon in the path as the separator in the script definition. Using a relative path to the script (which doesn't include a colon) works as intended.",,https://github.com/nasa/CCDD/issues/13
CCDD hangs when running script via -execute,"The command shown below is intended to run a script on a group to generate outputs. The documentation states that the -execute argument should result in a headless run of the script, however the CCDD Gui window pops up unexpectedly. Many queries are run and then the output freezes. After several minutes I ended up terminating CCDD due to apparent inactivity.

Command:
```java -cp C:\My\Absolute\CCDD\Path\CCDD.jar CCDD.CcddMain -logPath C:\My\Absolute\Log\Path -project myProject -user myUser -password #### -execute 'myScript.js:Group:myGroup' -scriptOutPath C:\My\Absolute\Out\Path```

Running the same database/same user/same script/same group/same paths via the GUI completes successfully in several seconds. I also observe this behavior when attempting to call one of the standard scripts, itosRecFile.js.

Not sure if its relevant/equatable, but starting the Gui, running the script, and closing the Gui resulted in 249 entries in the log file whereas running the script via the -execute argument results in ~50,000 entries in the log file before it stops updating and I terminate CCDD. I haven't closely examined the logs, but that seems to indicate that its doing vastly different things in each case.

Not sure if its relevant, but when letting the script run until the log stops updating (after several minutes), I notice that the last two entries are always:
```
localhost:5432|myProject|myUser|06/08/2018 08:57:43.015|Success|Project 'myProject' unlocked
localhost:5432|myProject|myUser|06/08/2018 08:57:43.016|Success|Project database 'myProject' closed
```

Java exception when unlocking database,"When opening CCDD, receive message: 
`Cannot connect to project database '######' as user '######'; cause 'database is locked'`

In response, I go to the menu and select Project > Unlock and click the 'Unlock' button. Gui doesn't respond and terminal shows the error message below. Restarting CCDD/repeating the process yields the same message.

Below is an image of the unlock dialog. According to the user guide, the dialog is supposed to list projects which may be unlocked, but mine is not.

Possible Command Import Bug? ,"I'm currently integrating a C2 system called COSMOS with CCDD for use with CubeSats. The telemetry configuration file integration has gone smoothly and is now automated. However, when importing commands into CCDD using CSV format I have noticed the Arg 1 Minimum and Arg 1 Maximum fields, when given column values, seem to stymie importation. It's almost certainly isolated to these two fields as I added a custom ""Endianness"" field at the end using the Table Type Editor and this was rendered fine into CCDD whenever I deleted any values for Arg 1 Minimum and Arg 1 Maximum. Any addition of these values causes the entire table to fail to load.  I was wondering if you're aware of any outstanding bug.  I cannot attach any example files I have been working with as they may contain classified information, but you can e-mail me at matthew.t.prelich@nasa.gov if you wish to speak further about this issue. Your name did not have an associated e-mail listed with it in the internal global address book.",,https://github.com/nasa/CCDD/issues/10
Git-based CCDD Workflow - Request for Import/Export commands,"I'm looking at using CCDD for a project which utilizes git as its code's CM system. The goal is to use CCDD to generate the interface artifacts (header files, ground system definitions, ICDs, etc) using the CCDD scripting interfaces. By git's nature, there may be multiple branches of the code which have different versions of an interface and it may be necessary to generate the interface artifacts for a particular branch. Can you suggest how to best utilize CCDD in this scenario?

My understanding is that the import/export when using the JSON and CSV formats is lossless (ie, its an exact definition of the database). My thought is to export the CCDD database and commit that to the git branch it describes. When a developer needs to make an interface change to a particular branch they'd import the database from that branch into CCDD, make the change, generate their artifacts, and then export the database and commit the new version of the database to their branch. 

I believe this workflow offers the best of both worlds... managing the interface definition with the code that it represents while utilizing CCDD as the editing interface (to maintain database consistency) and leveraging it's scripting interfaces to generate the required artifacts.

I don't currently see a way to automate importing and exporting databases... this workflow could be almost entirely automated if the CCDD executable supported an 'import' and 'export' command which provided similar functionality to the respective dialogs. Is this something that is on the development roadmap?

Thanks

isStructureShared returns true for structure with only one parent,"I'm not sure if I'm misunderstanding the documentation for the isStructureShared method, or if there is a bug with the implementation. The documentation for isStructureShared states: ""Determine if the specified structure is referenced by more than one parent structure"". 

In my database, I have a structure 'PriHdr' which is a field in 'TlmHdr' which is a field in multiple other structures. PriHdr only has one parent (TlmHdr) whereas TlmHdr has many parents, however isStructureShared returns true for both. 

I also have a structure 'TestData' which is a field in 'TestPkt'. TestPkt has no parents and TestData only has TestPkt as a parent. As expected, isStructureShared returns false for both.

The current implementation appears to determine if a structure has multiple root tables as ancestors, not multiple parents (based on the terminology defined in section 4.5.1). It would be helpful to clarify the documentation so that its consistent with the definitions earlier in the guide. 

My application is that I am attempting to generate a database for COSMOS (http://cosmosrb.com/). For data structures which are utilized within multiple packets, they recommend defining the structure once in a separate file and using render (http://cosmosrb.com/news/2016/09/12/erb-config/) to include in where needed in the packet definition. Only in the case that a structure has multiple parents is it necessary to create a new file, which I was attempting to use isStructureShared to detect. In this application, its undesirable to detect if a structure has multiple ancestors because it only needs to be placed in a separate file if it has multiple parents. If isStructureShared is not the appropriate method to detect a single parent, could you suggest an alternative method?",,https://github.com/nasa/CCDD/issues/8
Incorrect documentation for isDataTypePrimitive and isStructureShared,"The contents of the 'Description' and 'Input(s)' columns of the table on page 174 of the users guide appears to be swapped for rows describing the methods isDataTypePrimitive and isStructureShared.

The description/input for isStructureShared references datatypes and the description/input for isDataTypePrimitive references structures. Appears that swapping the rows would solve the issue.

Command-line script execution documentation appears to be inaccurate,"Section 4.6.10 of the user guide documents how to execute a script from the command line. Documentation states that the argument format of `-execute <script_name>:<table>` or  `-execute <script_name>:Group:<group_name>`. Argument format appears to actually be `-execute <script_association_name>:<script_name>:<table>` or `-execute <script_association_name>:<script_name>:Group:<group_name>`.

Attempting to run `-execute myScript:myTable` results in `Cannot execute script ‘myTable’ using table(s) ' '`. Running `-execute myAssociation:myScript:myTable` completes successfully. Using a myAssociation not in the database results in an error ""Unrecognized association name"".

Also, documentation states that script path is required if they’re not stored in the same location as the CCDD executes, however commands without path succeed for scripts located in the /scripts directory (did not test with other locations).
